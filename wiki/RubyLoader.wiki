#summary A CFC to load & run Ruby scripts via ColdFusion
#labels Featured

=== INTRODUCTION ===

Ruby allows for the execution of Ruby scripts within Java. ColdFusion gives us access to this functionality via our 
ability to call Java objects with createObject().  RubyLoader attempts to abstract as much of this work as possible from the ColdFusion 
developer so that you can leverage the power of Ruby scripts within your ColdFusion applications.

=== INSTALLATION ===

The following are the steps for installing the RubyLoader CFC.  

1.  Copy contents of the /lib directory into ${ColdFusionRoot}/cfusion/lib directory
2.  Copy contents of the /src directory into your webroot.

=== USAGE ===

See /src/example.cfm for an example of how to use RubyLoader

=== LICENSE ===

See the license.txt file included with this bundle.
